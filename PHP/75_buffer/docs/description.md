In PHP, [`obj_start()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ob-start.php) is a function used to start output buffering. This means that any output generated by PHP after the `ob_start()` call will not be sent to the browser or client immediately, but instead will be stored in an internal buffer.
To retrieve the contents of the buffer, you can use the [`ob_get_contents()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ob-get-contents.php) function. This function returns the contents of the buffer as a string, without clearing the buffer itself.
Once you're done with the output buffering, you can use the [`ob_end_clean()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ob-end-clean.php) function to discard the contents of the buffer and turn off output buffering. This function removes all data from the output buffer and disables buffering.
Alternatively, you can use the [`ob_get_clean()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ob-get-clean.php) function, which returns the contents of the output buffer as a string and turns off output buffering in one step. This function is equivalent to calling `ob_get_contents()` followed by `ob_end_clean()`.
